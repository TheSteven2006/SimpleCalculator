# SimpleCalculator

A calculator project in Java involves creating an application that allows you to perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

To create the calculator, we start from the creation of the graphical interface, using the Swing framework. The interface includes a display to show the result of operations and a series of numeric and operational buttons.

Once the interface has been created, we proceed to write the code to handle the events of the buttons. The number buttons are linked to a memory area where the value of the number entered by the user is stored, while the operation buttons operate on the various operations.

For example, the add button adds the current value to another variable, the subtract button subtracts the current value from the other variable, and so on.

Finally, once the operating logic has been defined, the code can be compiled and the application created.

The Java Calculator can be used as an example project for students who want to learn Java programming. Furthermore, this project is easily customizable and can be improved, for example, by adding advanced features such as square roots, trigonometric functions or operations with decimal numbers.
